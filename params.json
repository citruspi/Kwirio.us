{"body":"### Introduction\r\nTo put it simply, Kwirio.us is a PHP script which accepts MD5 hashes and then attempts to find the \"clear text\" from which the hash was derived. Kwirio.us is special because it doesn't:\r\n\r\n* use recursive algorithm to brute force the hash\r\n* use a large database which requires 5MB to 50PB of space\r\n* use a word list and attempt a dictionary crack\r\n\r\nInstead, it uses the Internet[1] as a database - it acts as a meta search engine and searches through multiple other sites (including Google) for the hash. In this way, it acts as an interface between your application and other services so that you don't have to implement them yourself.\r\n\r\n[1] It comes with a few services implemented. Additional services can be easily implemented by adding as few as six lines of PHP code.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nKwirio.us is easy to implement and can be implemented in as little as seven lines of code. There are only three methods which you must call order to crack a hash:\r\n\r\n* `sethash()`\r\n* `validate()`\r\n* `crack()`\r\n\r\nIf you ran:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n    include('Kwirio.php');\r\n        \r\n    $Kwirious = new Kwirio();\r\n        \r\n    $Kwirious->setHash('b45cffe084dd3d20d928bee85e7b0f21');       \r\n        \r\n    if($Kwirious->validate())\r\n        echo $Kwirious->crack();\r\n    else\r\n        echo \"Please set a valid hash.\"; \r\n?>\r\n```\r\n\r\nit would print out:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstring\r\n```\r\n\r\n### An API\r\n\r\nA Sample Kwirio.us API:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n  header('content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8');\r\n                \r\n  include('Kwirious/Kwirio.php');\r\n                \r\n  $Kwirious = new Kwirio();\r\n                \r\n  $Kwirious->setHash($_GET['h']);   \r\n                \r\n  $data = array();    \r\n                \r\n  if($Kwirious->validate()){\r\n    $rslt = $Kwirious->crack();\r\n                \r\n    if($rslt == \"Hash not cracked! :(\")\r\n      $data = array(\"hash\" => $_GET['h'], \"valid\" => TRUE, \"found\" => FALSE, \"result\" => \"\"); \r\n    else\r\n      $data = array(\"hash\" => $_GET['h'], \"valid\" => TRUE, \"found\" => TRUE, \"result\" => $rslt);         \r\n  }\r\n                \r\n  else\r\n    $data = array(\"hash\" => $_GET['h'], \"valid\" => FALSE, \"found\" => FALSE, \"result\" => \"\");  \r\n                \r\n  $pattern = array(',\"', '{', '}');\r\n  $replacement = array(\",\\n\\t\\\"\", \"{\\n\\t\", \"\\n}\");\r\n  $rspn = str_replace($pattern, $replacement, json_encode($data));\r\n                \r\n  echo $rspn;     \r\n?>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, if an HTTP request was made to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp://domain.com/API.php?h=b45cffe084dd3d20d928bee85e7b0f21\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe response would be:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"hash\":\"b45cffe084dd3d20d928bee85e7b0f21\",\r\n  \"valid\":true,\r\n  \"found\":true,\r\n  \"result\":\"string\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Services\r\n\r\nThe services which are implemented in Kwirio.us as of this point are:\r\n\r\n|Service Name|Version Implemented|\r\n|:-----------|:-----------------:|\r\n|collision | v0.1 |\r\n|noisette | v0.1 |\r\n|rednoize | v0.1 |\r\n|ramsey | v0.1 |\r\n|darkbyte | v0.1 |\r\n|md5-hash | v0.1 |\r\n|google | v0.1  |\r\n|gromweb | v0.1 |\r\n\r\n### License\r\nZinc is open source and is distributed under the MIT License:\r\n\r\n    Copyright © 2012 Mihir Singh <me@mihirsingh.com>\r\n\r\n\tPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of \r\n\tthis software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in \r\n\tthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to \r\n\tuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of \r\n\tthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do \r\n\tso, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n\tThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all \r\n\tcopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n\tTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY \r\n\tKIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE \r\n\tWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR \r\n\tPURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
